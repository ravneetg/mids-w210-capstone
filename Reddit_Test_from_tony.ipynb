      "I took my son to a toddler birthday party this weekend, fully expecting to hide in a corner while the kids played around. However, my buddy hosting the party took me aside and goes, \"Want to try some of this?\" I looked down and saw a nearly empty bottle of Stagg; my jaw dropped. He told me he used to collect, and that he had a few bottles of this laying around. OF COURSE I wanted to try it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Careful not to empty another man's bottle, I poured myself a few ounces. What happened next was nothing short of magical.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Color &amp;amp; Body:** Medium caramel, much lighter than I expected but dark enough to feel like bourbon.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Nose:** Apple, cinnamon, licorice, nutmeg, leather, sweet tobacco. Reminded me of eating an apple pie in the dog days of summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Taste:** Brown sugar, pecans, brown butter, Fuji apples, followed by sweet oak, persimmon, and anise. There was just enough spice to provide a heavy, complex layer to the sweetness up front. In fact, all of these notes seemed to unfold like a symphony in different movements. I've never tasted a bourbon quite as rich as this.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mouthfeel:** Really buttery, felt like it just danced around on the sides and back of my tongue. I was amazed at how little heat I felt from a 143 proof whiskey.\n",

      "I took my son to a toddler birthday party this weekend, fully expecting to hide in a corner while the kids played around. However, my buddy hosting the party took me aside and goes, \"Want to try some of this?\" I looked down and saw a nearly empty bottle of Stagg; my jaw dropped. He told me he used to collect, and that he had a few bottles of this laying around. OF COURSE I wanted to try it.\n",

      "**Color &amp;amp; Body:** Medium caramel, much lighter than I expected but dark enough to feel like bourbon.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Nose:** Apple, cinnamon, licorice, nutmeg, leather, sweet tobacco. Reminded me of eating an apple pie in the dog days of summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Taste:** Brown sugar, pecans, brown butter, Fuji apples, followed by sweet oak, persimmon, and anise. There was just enough spice to provide a heavy, complex layer to the sweetness up front. In fact, all of these notes seemed to unfold like a symphony in different movements. I've never tasted a bourbon quite as rich as this.\n",

      "**Nose:**  Syrupy molasses, thick, dark, sweet, dark chocolate, custard, cooked apples way in the back, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, musty cellar, herbal / vegetal note, a heavy nose.  Thick, dark, dense and heavy.  Fantastic.  With water, the menthol cooling note increases, smoky burnt popcorn, almost makes me think of pungent peat smoke.  With even more time with a cover on the glass: orange zest.  \n",

      "\n",
      "**Finish:** Scones, nutmeg, oak, burnt toffee, oolong tea.  That vegetal note again.  Finish is actually stronger with a few drops of water, or maybe it’s just accumulating with each sip. With time, chocolate covered cherry, chocolate candied orange wedge. \n",
